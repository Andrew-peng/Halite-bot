# Halite-bot
Final submission for the [Halite programming competition](https://halite.io). I built my bot off of brianvanleeuwen's [ML starter bot](https://github.com/brianvanleeuwen/Halite-ML-starter-bot). It uses Keras, a python deep learning library, with a TensorFlow backend. I trained my bot exclusively on erdmanv17 games downloaded with downloadgames.py and rotated the board to incorporate 4x as much training data. 

The bot reached rank __/1592 (Gold)
